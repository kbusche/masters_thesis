I would like to thank my adviser, Prof. Minh Do, for his guidance and support
throughout the research process, in addition to chatting about our shared
passion for distance running. I also would like to thank the members of the
Computational Imaging Group for their support and friendship. Finally, I would
like to thank my family and friends for their ongoing love and support.
