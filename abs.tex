In recent years, Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar technology has
rapidly improved and become more widespread. FMCW radars for the automotive
industry have moved to becoming single-chip products, operating at 77 GHz
carrier frequencies and bandwidths allowing for up to 3.75 cm range resolution,
while staying relatively low power. In this thesis, we will discuss the
techniques for determing distances, velocities, and angular position of targets
with a FMCW radar, with applications such as collision detection and assisted
cruise control in modern vehicles. We will discuss the use of a two-dimensional
Fast Fourier Transform to efficiently compute the Doppler-range bins for a
linear FMCW. A rudimentary geometric approach to angle estimation will then be
discussed, followed by a look at the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC)
approach for angle estimation.
