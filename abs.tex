In this thesis, we will discuss the
techniques for determing distances, velocities, and angular position of targets
using a Frequency Modulated Continous Wave (FMCW) radar. FMCW radars have
applications such as collision detection and assisted
cruise control in modern vehicles, due to their ability to be manufactured as
low-power, single-chip systems. We will discuss the use of a two-dimensional
Fast Fourier Transform to efficiently compute the Doppler-range bins for a
linear FMCW. A rudimentary geometric approach to angle estimation will then be
discussed, followed by a look at the Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC)
approach for angle estimation.
