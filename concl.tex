\chapter{Conclusion}
In this work, the processing chain for linear frequency-modulated 
continuous-wave radars was explored. We demonstrated how the sawtooth frequency modulation
gives rise to the beat-frequency phenomenon from the combined transmit-receive
signals and contains the range information via the time delay. Furthermore, we
investigated the influence of an object's velocity on the phases for return
signals corresponding to different chirps and how to leverage this information
with a second Fourier transform to recover the Doppler frequencies. Next, we
discussed angular position estimation for multiple-input multiple-output radar
systems, first by a simple geometric estimation and second by the
subspace-based multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm. Finally, we
presented simulated results of a 77 GHz FMCW radar system based on Texas Instruments's
IWR 1443 chip and investigated the effects of several configurable system
parameters on range and velocity detection performance.
